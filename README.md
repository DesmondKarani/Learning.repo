 My FreeCcodeCamp coding journey.
I started by building a website struture as a daily practice after every Free Code Camp lesson. The file is labelled "trial."
I learned much from this initial practice, especially about lists and forms.
One of the hardest things I encountered was the best way to incorporate effective forms.
I had to research other content to get the skills needed for this.
I decided to create a sign up form with what I had learned.
This was form was very enlightneing.
