This will be an unconventional README consisting of advice on approaching web development as a beginner. If you’re a self-learning student like me with a full-time job, this is for you. 

One of the things I have learned in this journey is that getting into a coding career requires a solid roadmap. Free Code Camp will provide an excellent roadmap to follow. Further, it would be best if you also had a lot of discipline, organization skills, and self-awareness to keep yourself motivated along the way. Trust me; it won’t be easy. Nonetheless, the moment you start building things with code and seeing them materialize will be gratifying… Just don’t get too comfortable with the basics. It’s about the journey, not the ending.

I will update my learning journey in this REPO until I complete the entire FCC curriculum.

The first thing you’ll learn is HTML basics. Most parts of this course are straightforward. But I suggest you understand the concepts by incorporating multiple learning materials other than Free Code Camp practice tests. Great resources include YouTube, Mozilla (MDN Web Docs), Udemy, Stack Overflow, and Frontend Mentor (for challenges). Remember, it’s about understanding the concepts, not just the syntax.

Most of the HTML concepts are easy to understand. The only area you are likely to face a little challenge is when creating forms and labels. You’ll learn about buttons, checkboxes, inputs, and attributes that make these elements work. Do not just rely on one source for this if you want to understand the concepts of forms.

On CSS, you will immediately realize that it relies heavily on HTML DOM, reinforcing your understanding of this markup language even further. The CSS ruleset will demand you learn how various selectors interact with HTML. Don’t be overwhelmed by the jargon; trust me, you’ll learn them with time.


There is a LOT to learn in CSS, especially about styling tables and lists. Do not skimp on this area.
